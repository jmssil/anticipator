Anticipator: a simulation framework for Virtuoso (OSS-based netlister)

This was meant to be a complete front-end (simulation) framework for
Virtuoso, but is just an OSS-based netlister (as of version 0.4).

It works by automatically creating the "hspice" views from the
"hspiceD" views, so that the cells can be netlisted with OSS.

This netlister can be used as a cheap replacement for Virtuoso Analog
Design Environment netlister.
